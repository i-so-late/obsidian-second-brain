"""On a stock Windows install `python3` is the Microsoft Store App Execution
Alias: it exists, prints nothing, and exits non-zero. The SessionStart hook ran
that name directly and injected nothing, and validate-ai-first.sh gated checks 5,
6 and 7 behind `command -v python3`, which the stub passes - so the substitution,
secret and tag checks were skipped without a word while checks 1-4 kept firing
and made the hook look alive (#269).

These pin the resolution (run a candidate, do not look it up), the two inline
copies of it, and the entry points that used to hardcode the name.
